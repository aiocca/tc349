				<p class="articleText">Gameplay, of the the most crucial parts of the game. Here there is no right or wrong answer. A game can have anything as their gameplay, the only catch is that it has to be engaging and fun. That’s why today we enjoy many different genres and how many more are still being created. There used to be just a few big genres such as Action, Racing, Sports, etc. Now today there exists niche genres of any overarching one. Rogue-like is one example. It is a niche genre of Action. Rogue-like basically means that there will be randomness that allows for replayability and mechanics that allow for skillful play. The skillful play is one of the things that people look for in this niche genre. The more you play, the better you get at the game and so you play it for longer than the average action game. Now another feature to keep the players seeking these games out is some kind of scoring system or ability to compete with others, even though the game is only single-player. Online leaderboards or even personal leaderboards are small things that keep many people playing your game plenty of time after it’s been released. Basically for gameplay like I said there isn’t a right or wrong, but you have to understand that your game needs to be engaging just like any other media and it also has to cater to the types of players who play games similar to yours.</p>
