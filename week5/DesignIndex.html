<p>Good 80%-20% Ratio</p>
<img src="img/8020Good.png">
<p>Blizzard Entertainment service Battle.net is a good example of the 80/20 Ratio rule because usually most of their views or income come from one game at a time for periods of times.</p>

<p>Bad 80%-20% Ratio</p>

<p>EA is a good example of bad 80/20 because they are a broad publishing company that has stakes in many different kinds of games, so their views come from many different games' audiences.</p>

<p>Good Hick's Law</p>
<img src="img/HicksGood.png">
<p>gtbicycles is a good example of Hick's Law because they specifically sell Gravity brand bicycles, there are no other brands to consider so it doesn't slow down your decision making.</p>

<p>Bad Hick's Law</p>
<img src="img/HicksLawBad.png">
<p>Amazon is a prime offender of Hick's Law, not only does Amazon sell products from multiple brands and sellers, they also link you to related products and things that you may like after looking at one product. These features make a customer who is just trying to buy one thing increase their decision making time</p>

<p>Good Modularity</p>
<img src="img/ModularityGood.png">
<p>Twitch does a good job with modularity, making many sub categories for each possible game a viewer could want to watch, that is currently being broadcast.</p>

<p>Bad Modularity</p>
<img src="img/ModularityBad.png">
<p>pcgamer is a bad example of modularity, because their categories for their content are very poor, also when scanning the website the content isn't very easy to find specific content because of all the different feeds that serve different purposes..</p>

<p>Good Ockham's Razor</p>
<img src="img/RazorGood.png">
<p>Gamespot is a good example of Ockham's Razor because, the way they categorize their content by console or system as well as reviews and news really make it simple and easy.</p>

<p>Bad Ockham's Razor</p>
<img src="img/RazorBad.png">
<p>bonesbrigadedjs.com is a bad example of Ockham's razor, throughout the website the viewer is presented with large and vibrant images for content, these images although making the site simple to understand, make it very difficult to process what is happening when being bombarded by large bright images.</p>

<p>Good Signal-To-Noise Ratio</p>
<img src="img/SignalGood.png">
<p>Wikepedia is a great example of Signal-To-Noise because, for the most part each article gives you a brief and helpful description of what it is about and everything you need to know while also providing more extensive information.</p>

<p>Bad Signal-To-Noise Ratio</p>
<img src="img/SignalGood.png">
<p>Gameinformer is a bad example of Signal-To-Noise Ratio because their articles go very in-depth to what the writer thinks about the particular news or game with very little summary as to what you need to know.</p>
